The QUNET ERC-20 smart contract has been deployed on Ethereum Mainnet

## Audit Targets (Planned)
One or more of the following independent auditors may be engaged:

- OpenZeppelin
- CertiK
- Trail of Bits
- Quantstamp
- Independent Solidity auditors

## Timeline
- Audit request: Planned
- Audit execution: Pending

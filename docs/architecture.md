# QUNET System Architecture

## Overview

QUNET is designed as a minimal, research-oriented authorization and execution
architecture. The system separates authorization, decision-making, and execution
into distinct layers to reduce trust assumptions and minimize systemic risk.

The QUNET Token functions as the **final settlement and coordination layer**
within this architecture. It does not generate authorization and does not make
decisions. Its role is limited to confirming and finalizing already approved actions.

## Architectural Principles

The QUNET architecture is based on the following principles:

- Separation of concerns
- Minimal on-chain logic
- No administrative control paths
- Deterministic execution
- Explicit authorization flow
- Economic finality only after approval

These principles are intentionally enforced through both system design
and smart contract limitations.

## Core Components

### 1. LIPAS — Authorization Source

LIPAS is responsible for generating authorization signals.

Characteristics:
- Off-chain or hybrid system
- May use biometric, liveness, or cryptographic proofs
- Does not interact directly with the blockchain
- Produces authorization data only

Role:
- Authorization generation
- Identity and intent verification

---

### 2. QUP — Decision Engine

QUP evaluates authorization signals produced by LIPAS.

Characteristics:
- Applies policy, rules, or logic
- Determines approval or rejection
- Does not execute actions
- Does not manage economic settlement

Role:
- Decision validation
- Authorization approval logic

---

### 3. QUPAY — Execution Interface

QUPAY executes actions after successful authorization and approval.

Characteristics:
- Handles execution or payment interfaces
- Operates only after positive decision output
- Does not issue authorization
- Does not modify token supply

Role:
- Execution of approved operations
- Interface between systems and outcomes

---

### 4. QUNET Token — Settlement & Finality Layer

The QUNET ERC-20 token acts as the final settlement layer.

Characteristics:
- Fixed supply
- No minting or burning
- No administrative privileges
- Immutable after deployment

Role:
- Economic finalization of approved actions
- Coordination mechanism across components
- Prevents execution without validated authorization

The token **does not replace authorization systems**.
It enforces that economic value is only consumed
after successful authorization and approval.

---

## Authorization Flow (High-Level)

1. Authorization is generated by LIPAS
2. Authorization is evaluated by QUP
3. Approved decisions are forwarded to QUPAY
4. QUNET Token is used to finalize and settle the action

At no point does the token initiate authorization or decision-making.

---

## Security Model

- No single component has full control
- No on-chain governance or override mechanisms
- No upgrade or pause functionality
- Token contract is intentionally minimal

This design minimizes attack surface and
reduces long-term maintenance risk.
